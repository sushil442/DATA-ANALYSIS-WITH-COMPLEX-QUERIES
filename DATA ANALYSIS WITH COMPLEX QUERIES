TASK 2:
•	CREATE TABLE STUDENT:-
CREATE TABLE students (
student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
score INT,
class VARCHAR(50),
exam_date DATE
);
•	INSERTING THE DATA IN TABLE:-
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, score, class, exam_date)
VALUES
(1, 'Bhavesh', 85, 'Math', '2025-01-15'),
(2, 'Sushil', 78, 'Math', '2025-01-15'),
(3, 'Payal', 92, 'Math', '2025-01-15'),
(4, 'Avira', 75, 'Science', '2025-01-16'),
(5, 'Chhaku', 82, 'Science', '2025-01-16'),
(6, 'Pranali', 82, 'Math', '2025-01-20'),
(7, 'Tanu', 91, 'Math', '2025-01-20'); 

•	PERFORM ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS:- Rank Students by Score in Each Class
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank_within_class
FROM students;
 
•	SUBQUERY EXAMPLE:- Find Students Who Scored Above the Average in Their Class
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class
FROM students
WHERE score > (
SELECT AVG(score)
FROM students
WHERE class = students.class
);
 
•	COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION (CTE): Top 3 Students by Score in Each Class
WITH ranked_students AS (
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank_within_class
FROM students
)
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class
FROM ranked_students
WHERE rank_within_class <= 3;
 
•	WINDOW FUNCTION :-  Calculate Cumulative Score for Each Student
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
exam_date,
SUM(score) OVER (PARTITION BY student_id ORDER BY exam_date) AS cumulative_score
FROM students;
 
•	SUBQEURY:-  Find Students Who Scored Above the Overall Average Score
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class
FROM students
WHERE score > (
SELECT AVG(score)
FROM students
);
 

•	CTE AND WINDOW FUNCTION:- Find Students Who Scored Above the Class Average and Rank Them.
WITH class_avg_score AS (
SELECT class,
AVG(score) AS avg_score
FROM students
GROUP BY class
)
SELECT s.student_id,
s.name,
s.score,
s.class,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.class ORDER BY s.score DESC) AS rank_within_class
FROM students s
JOIN class_avg_score cas
ON s.class = cas.class
WHERE s.score > cas.avg_score;
 
•	Find the Best Scorer in Each Class Using SUBQEURY
SELECT student_id,
name,
score,
class
FROM students
WHERE (class, score) IN (
SELECT class, MAX(score)
FROM students
GROUP BY class
);
